This branch is FreeMarker 3.0, apparently a dead effort now. So don't
do anything with this, unless you are really comitted to continue this
effort.

As of 2012-03-01, the active branches and their role:

- 2.3.x on sf.net SVN. This is the stable, maintained branch that has
  actual releases.

- 2.4.x on GitHub (https://github.com/freemarker/freemarker). This is
  work-in-progress, and has no releases yet. It focuses on *minor*
  clean-ups (mostly regarding the dependencies/requirements) that
  doesn't break backward compatiblilty much, yet not compatible enough
  to be part of the 2.3.x series.
