As of the 2.4 release cycle, FreeMarker is developed against JDK 1.5. However,
we still support backward compatibility with JDK 1.4 via the Retrotranslator
tool. (See http://retrotranslator.sf.net/ )

For those building against the source, note that the retrotrans and retrojar
ant build targets respectively use retrotranslator to build the .class files 
and .jar file that are compatible with 1.4. The 1.4-compatible .jar file 
is significantly bigger than the regular freemarker.jar since it
contains runtime support classes from retrotranslator. The license terms
for retrotranslator are exact the same BSD-style license that FreeMarker uses.


Finally, note that, while we continue to support use of JDK 1.4, we are 
indeed abandoning support for 1.3 and earlier.
