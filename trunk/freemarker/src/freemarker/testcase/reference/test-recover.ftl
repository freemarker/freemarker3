 Hello, World
 Well, that did not work. Here is the error: Expression undefined is undefined on line 8, column 47 in test-recover.ftl.
 Now we nest another attempt/recover here:
   Oops: Expression sequence[1] is undefined on line 13, column 6 in test-recover.ftl.
   Remember, freeMarker sequences are zero-based! Hello, World
 Now we output the current error message: Expression undefined is undefined on line 8, column 47 in test-recover.ftl.
  The template is not currently available
  The included template has a problem: Expression undefined_variable is undefined on line 1, column 3 in undefined.ftl.
