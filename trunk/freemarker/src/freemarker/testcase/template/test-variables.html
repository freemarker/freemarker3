<title>FreeMarker: Variable Test</title>
</head>
<body>
<#assign list = ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"]>
<#assign hash = {"output" : "My message.", "key" : list}>
<#assign hash2 = {"value" : hash}>
<#assign items = {"mykey" : "key", "_test": "out"}>

<p>A simple test follows:</p>

<p>${message}</p>

<p>Now get into variable nesting:</p>

<p>${hash.output}</p>
<p>${hash["output"]}</p>
<p>${hash. output}</p>
<p>${hash .output}</p>
<p>${hash
    .output}</p>
<p>${hash
    . output}</p>
<p>${hash ["output"]}</p>
<p>${hash
    [ "output" ]}</p>

<p>More deep nesting...</p>

<p>${hash2.value.output}</p>
<p>${hash2.value.key[0]}</p>
<p>${hash2["value"]["key"][0]}</p>


<p>Nesting inside nesting...</p>

<p>${hash2.value[ items.mykey ][ 1 ]}</p>
<p>${hash2.value[ items[ "mykey" ]][ 1 ]}</p>
<p>${hash2.value[ items[ "my" + items.mykey ]][ 1 ]}</p>
<p>${hash2.value[ items[ "my" + items["mykey"] ]][ 1 ]}</p>

<p>Test underscores...</p>

<p>${items[ "_test" ]}</p>
<p>${items._test}</p>
