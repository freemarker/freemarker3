/**
 * A simple implementation of {@link TemplateCollectionModel}.
 * It's able to wrap <tt>java.util.Iterator</tt>-s and <tt>java.util.Collection</tt>-s.
 * If you wrap an <tt>Iterator</tt>, the variable can be &lt;list>-ed (&lt;forach>-ed) only once!
 *
 * <p>Consider using {@link SimpleSequence} instead of this class if you want to wrap <tt>Iterator</tt>s.
 * <tt>SimpleSequence</tt> will read all elements of the <tt>Iterator</tt>, and store them in a <tt>List</tt>
 * (this may cause too high resource consumption in some applications), so you can list the variable
 * for unlimited times. Also, if you want to wrap <tt>Collection</tt>s, and then list the resulting
 * variable for many times, <tt>SimpleSequence</tt> may gives better performance, as the
 * wrapping of non-<tt>TemplateModel</tt> objects happens only once.
 *
 * <p>This class is thread-safe. The returned <tt>TemplateModelIterator</tt>-s
 * are <em>not</em> thread-safe.
