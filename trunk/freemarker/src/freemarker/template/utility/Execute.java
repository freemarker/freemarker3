/**
 * <p>Gives FreeMarker the the ability to execute external commands. Will fork
 * a process, and inline anything that process sends to stdout in the template.
 * Based on a patch submitted by Peter Molettiere.</p>
 *
 * <p>BE CAREFUL! this tag, depending on use, may allow you
 * to set something up so that users of your web
 * application could run arbitrary code on your server.
 * This can only happen if you allow unchecked GET/POST
 * submissions to be used as the command string in the
 * exec tag.</p>
 *
 * <p>Usage:<br />
 * From java:</p>
 * <pre>
 * SimpleHash root = new SimpleHash();
 *
 * root.put( "exec", new freemarker.template.utility.Execute() );
 *
 * ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>From your FreeMarker template:</p>
 * <pre>
 *
 * The following is executed:
 * ${exec( "/usr/bin/ls" )}
 *
 * ...
 * </pre>
