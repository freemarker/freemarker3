# Version info for the builds.

# Version number
# --------------
#
# The version number format is (since FreeMarker 2.4.0):
#
#   Version ::= major '.' minor '.' micro ('-' Qualifier)?
#   Qualifier :: = NightlyQualifier
#                  |
#                  ( ('pre'|'rc') twoDigitPositiveInteger ('-' NightlyQualifier)? )
#   NightlyQualifier :: = 'nightly_@timestampInVersion@'
#
# This format is compatible both with Maven and JSR 277, and it must
# remain so. Stable versions must not have a qualifier.
# Note that qualifiers are compared with String.compareTo,
# thus "nightly" < "pre" < "rc", etc.
#
# Examples:
#   Version number        Means
#   3.0.0                 3.0.0 stable release
#   3.3.12                3.3.12 stable release
#   3.3.13-nightly        Modified version after 3.3.12, which will
#                         become to 3.3.13 one day.
#   3.4.0-pre03           The 3rd preview of version 3.3.0
#   3.4.0-pre04-nightly   Unreleased nightly version of the yet unfinished
#                         3.3.0-pre04.
#   3.4.0-rc01            1st release candidate of 3.4.0
#
# Backward-compatibility policy (since FreeMarker 2.4.0):
# - When only the micro version number is increased, full backward
#   compatibility is expected (ignoring cases where code depends on
#   "features" that are obviously implementation bugs).
# - When the minor version number is increased, some minor backward
#   compatibility violations are allowed. Most dependent code should
#   continue working without modification or recompilation.
# - When the major version number is increased, major backward
#   compatibility violations are allowed.
version=3.0.0-pre02-nightly_@timestampInVersion@

# Version string that conforms to OSGi
# ------------------------------------
#
# This is different from the plain version string:
# - "." is used instead of a "-" before the qualifier.
# - The stable releases must uses a "stable" qualifier.
#   Example: 3.2.1.stable
versionForOSGi=3.0.0.pre02-nightly_@timestampInVersion@

# Version string that conforms to legacy MF
# -----------------------------------------
#
# Examples:
# version        -> versionForMf
# 2.2.5          -> 2.2.5
# 2.3.0.pre13    -> 2.2.98.13
# 2.3.0.pre13-nightly -> 2.2.98.13.97
# 2.3.0.rc1      -> 2.2.99.1
# 2.3.0          -> 2.3
# 2.3.0.nightly -> 2.3.0.97
# 3.0.0.pre2     -> 2.98.2
#
# 98 denotes "pre", 99 denotes "rc", "97 denotes "mod" (usually a nightly build).
# In general, for the preview Y or rc Y of version 2.X, the versionForMf is
# 2.X-1.(99|98).Y. Note the X-1.
versionForMf=2.98.1.97

# The date of the build.
# This should be automatically filled by the building tool (Ant).
