    <p>
      FMPP is a command-line tool, Ant task, and embeddable library, for generating text
      <em>files</em>. The files are generated directly by processing FreeMarker template
      files, and/or by processing (transforming) XML files with FreeMarker templates. It can process
      whole directories recursively.  It allows templates to split their output into multiple
      output files.

      Note that the FreeMarker download already includes a light-weight Ant task specialized
      on transforming XML files with FreeMarker templates. FMPP can do it too, but as it is
      more heavy-weight and more general purpose, it's harder to learn using it.
