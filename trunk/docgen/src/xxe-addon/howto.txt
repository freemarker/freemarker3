XMLmind XML Editor addon for FreeMarker Manual editing
======================================================

This addon customizes the bundled DocBook configuration so that
it will be better for FreeMarker Manual editing.

Tested with XXE 3.6.0 (the addon version at 2007-05-22).


How to install this addon?
--------------------------

Just copy the docbook-for-freemarker directory into
"addon" subdirectory of your XXE user preferences directory,
which is (usually):

On UNIX:
  $HOME/.xxe/addon
  
On Windows XP:
  C:\Documents and Settings\YOURNAME\Application Data\XMLmind\XMLeditor\addon

And then restart XXE if it were running. From then all DocBook XML-s
with "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.5//EN" public DTD ID will be opened
with this addon.


Using the ToC-like navigation
-----------------------------

Near the bottom of the XXE window you find a very thin (almost invisible)
second view frame. Just grab its separator and drag iy upwards with
a quick big uncontrolled tug. Now you will see the ToC instead of the main
view. Double click the chapter/section you want to jomp too. Then grab the
separator bar again, and drag it downwards, with a quick big uncontrolled
tug again. Now you see the normal view again, at the correct position.


Known issues
------------

- Only the FreeMarker documentation should be opened with this addon,
  not all "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.5//EN" XML-s. (In principle
  XXE could be started with this commandline switch to fix this:
    -putpref addonDir "/path/to/the/freemarker/specific/addons/"
  but for some reason it has no effect... I will look after this.)
  For now, you can manually chose the "DocBook" CSS from the View
  menu, instead of the default "DocBook for FreeMarker". Sorry...

- itemizedlist/listitem vertical spacing has problems.
