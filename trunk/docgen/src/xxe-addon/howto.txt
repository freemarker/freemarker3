XMLmind XML Editor addon for FreeMarker Manual editing
======================================================

This addon customizes the bundled DocBook configuration so that
it will be better for FreeMarker Manual editing. The cusomtization
will only affect the FreeMarker documentation, not other DocBook-s.

THIS ADDON REQUIRES AT LEAST XXE 3.6.1.


How to install
--------------

Just copy the docbook-for-freemarker directory into
"addon" subdirectory of your XXE user preferences directory,
which is (usually):

On UNIX:
  $HOME/.xxe/addon
  
On Windows XP:
  C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\Application Data\XMLmind\XMLeditor\addon
  (replace %USERNAME% with your user name that you see in the Windows start menu)

Then restart XXE if it were running. From now on all DocBook XML-s whose root
element has a conformance="freemarker-documentation-conventions" attribute will
be opened with this addon. Other docbooks are not affected.


Using the ToC-like navigation
-----------------------------

Near the bottom of the XXE window you find a very thin (almost invisible)
second view frame. Just grab its separator and drag it upwards with
a quick big uncontrolled tug. Now you will see the ToC instead of the main
view. Double click on the chapter/section you want to jump too. Then grab the
separator bar again, and drag it downwards, with a quick big uncontrolled
tug again. Now you see the normal view again, at the correct position.
