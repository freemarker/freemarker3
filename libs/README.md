This directory contains the various jarfiles necessary to compile all the FreeMarker code.
The minimal-lang-class.jar contains a the various .class files needed to compile
the support for Jython, JRuby, and Rhino in FreeMarker. It is quite unclear that anybody 
uses any of this and it may (or may not) be removed in later releases. In this FreeMarker 3
preview release, there was the goal of keeping everything working for now, and then deciding
later what to do.
