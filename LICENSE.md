[FreeMarker 3](https://github.com/freemarker/freemarker3) is a resumption of work on the well known FreeMarker template engine by the person who is, to all intents and purposes, the original author -- at least of the core parsing/rendering machinery, which really is, more than anything else, what FreeMarker really is. For a more in-depth history, see [here](https://doku.freemarker.es/doku.php?id=history). The only other person to have made a contribution to the codebase of any comparable scale is Attila Szegedi, who has stated that he has no objection to FreeMarker 3 simply being copyright Jonathan Revusky, since it simplifies matters considerably. 

To be clear (and since the question is bound to keep arising) the version of FreeMarker that is branded as [Apache FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/) is a continuation of the FreeMarker 2.3 codebase which was largely finalized in late 2004. This version being maintained and developed (again) by the original author is the most advanced version of FreeMarker available. It is also the continuation of a codebase that was never hosted on Apache.
