<p>Test cases for various aspects of the FreeMarker implementation. These use the
<a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">JUnit</a> testing
framework to carry out and report on tests.</p>

<p>To run the tests: </p>

<ul>
<li>Get a copy of JUnit from the 
 <a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">JUnit web site</a></li>
<li>Modify <code>testcase.properties</code> to point to the FreeMarker testcase
 directory on your local machine</li>
<li>Run one of the TestRunners in JUnit, such as <code>junit.swingui.TestRunner</code></li>
<li>Point the TestRunner at <code>freemarker.testcase.FreeMarkerTestSuite</code></li>
<li>Look for green...</li>
</ul>

<p>Any errors will result in the text of the failed test case(s) appearing in
your current working directory. From there it should be possible to diagnose
the cause of the failure.</p>
