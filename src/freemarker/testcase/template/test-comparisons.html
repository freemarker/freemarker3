<title>FreeMarker: Numeric Operations Test</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>A simple test follows:</p>

<p>${message}</p>

<p>Start with the increment operator:</p>
<#assign a1 = 0>
<p>a1 = ${a1}</p>
<#assign a1 = a1 + 1>
<p>a1 = ${a1}</p>
<#assign a1 = a1 + 1>
<p>a1 = ${a1}</p>

<p>Now the decrement operator:</p>
<#assign a2 = 5>
<p>a2 = ${a2}</p>
<#assign a2 = a2 - 1>
<p>a2 = ${a2}</p>
<#assign a2 = a2 - 1>
<p>a2 = ${a2}</p>
<#assign a2 = a2 - 1>
<p>a2 = ${a2}</p>
<#assign a2 = a2 - 1>
<p>a2 = ${a2}</p>
<#assign a2 = a2 - 1>
<p>a2 = ${a2}</p>
<#assign a2 = a2 - 1>
<p>a2 = ${a2}</p>
<#assign a2 = a2 - 1>

<p>Now the add operator:</p>
<#assign op1 = 5>
<#assign op2 = 3>
<#assign op3 = op1 + op2>
<p>op1 = ${op1}, op2 = ${op2}, op3 = ${op3}</p>
<#assign op3 = op3 + op2>
<p>op3 = ${op3}</p>

<p>And the subtract operator:</p>
<#assign op3 = op1 - op2 >
<p>op1 = ${op1}, op2 = ${op2}, op3 = ${op3}</p>
<#assign op3 = op3 - op2 >
<p>op3 = ${op3}</p>

<p>The comparison operators:</p>
<#assign list1 = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ]>
<#foreach item in list1>
   <p>Item is: ${item}</p>
   <#if item lt 5>
   <p>Item is less than five.</p>
   </#if>
   <#if item <= 7>
   <p>Item is less than or equals to seven.</p>
   </#if>
   <#if item gt 2>
   <p>Item is greater than two.</p>
   </#if>
   <#if (item >= 10)>
   <p>Item is greater than or equal to ten.</p>
   </#if>
</#foreach>
