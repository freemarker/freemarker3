<p>A simple test follows:</p>

<p>${message}</p>

<p>Now perform a number assignment:</p>

#{1.300000?double}

[#assign mynumber = 1.8, USA="en_US" /]
[#assign myfloat = mynumber?float /]

My number is: ${mynumber}
[#setting locale="en_US"]
My float is: #{myfloat ; m6}
The int part is: ${myfloat?int}

[#assign mymessage = mynumber?string]

${mymessage + 3}

<p>Now use numbers in assignment</p>

[#assign mymessage = 1 + 5]
${mymessage}

[#assign mymessage = mymessage + 2]
#{mymessage}

<p>Try numbers in tests</p>

[#if (mymessage == 152)]
MyMessage is 152
[#else]
MyMessage is not 152, its: ${mymessage}.
[/#if]

<if (mymessage > 5)>
   MyMessage is greater than five.
</if

[#switch mymessage]
	[#case 1]
		MyMessage is one
		[#break]

	[#case 15]
		MyMessage is fifteen
		[#break]
	
	[#case 152]
		MyMessage is one-five-two
		[#break]
	
	[#default]
		MyMessage is: ${mymessage}.
		[#break]
	
[/#switch]

<p>Now for numbers in dynamic keys:</p>

[#assign one = 1]
[#assign two = 2]

${list[ 1 ]}
${list[ 1 + 2 ]}

<p>Numbers in hashes:</p>

${hash[ 1 + "2" ]}
${hash[ "1" + 2 ]}
${hash[ "1" + two ]}


<p>Numbers in method calls:</p>

${call( 1 )}
${call( one )}
${call( one + "2" )}
${call( one + 2 )}
${call( 1 + 2 )}
