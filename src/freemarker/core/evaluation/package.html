<p>Provides model implementations that allow access to arbitrary Java objects.</p>
<p>Most of the issues dealing with beans are handled by the 
{@link freemarker.core.evaluation.BeansWrapper#wrap(Object)}and {@link 
freemarker.core.evaluation.BeansWrapper#getStaticModels()} methods. In normal cases, 
 these are the only methods
you should use to turn an arbitrary Java object into a 
FreeMarker {@link freemarker.template.WrappedVariable}. Additionally, you can manually create 
instance of any wrapper class using its constructors.
Note, however that in such cases you bypass the eventual model caching
of the wrapper.</p>
