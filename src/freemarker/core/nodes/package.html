<p>The classes in this package are AST nodes that are maintained manually. The vast majority of 
    AST nodes are simply generated by CongoCC and the functionality they have is "injected" into them 
    from "injections" that occur in the grammar file. The main reason not to use that pattern 
    is when the amount of code injected into the node gets unwieldy and one wants to be able to edit
    the code with the typical tooling provided by an IDE.
