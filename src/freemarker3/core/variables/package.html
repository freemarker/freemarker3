<p>The classes in this package mostly involve evaluating variables on the FreeMarker template level
    and "unwrapping" them into Java objects. Or the opposite, taking Java variables and munging them
    in some way to present them to the template layer. Provides model implementations that allow access 
    to arbitrary Java objects.</p>
<p>Also, pretty much all the usage of the Java reflection API is now hidden away in 
{@link freemarker3.core.variables.ReflectionCode}. </p>
