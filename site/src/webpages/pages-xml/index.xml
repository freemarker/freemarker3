  <section title="What is FreeMarker?">
    <p>
      FreeMarker is a "template engine"; a generic tool to generate
      text output (anything from HTML to autogenerated source code) based on templates.
      It's a Java package, a class library for Java programmers. It's not an
      application for end-users in itself, but something that programmers can embed into their
      products.
    </p>
    <p>
      FreeMarker is designed to be practical for the generation of
      <em>HTML Web pages</em>, particularly by servlet-based applications
      following the <em>MVC</em> (Model View Controller) pattern.
      The idea behind using the MVC pattern for dynamic Web pages is that
      you separate the designers (HTML authors) from the programmers.
      Everybody works on what they are good at. Designers can change the
      appearance of a page without programmers having to change or recompile code,
      because the application logic (Java programs) and page design
      (FreeMarker templates) are separated. Templates do not become polluted 
      with complex program fragments. This separation is useful even for projects
      where the programmer and the HMTL page author is the same person, since it helps
      to keep the application clear and easily maintainable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although FreeMarker has some programming capabilities, it is <em>not</em> 
      a full-blown programming language like PHP. Instead, Java programs
      prepare the data to be displayed (like issue SQL queries), and FreeMarker just generates 
      textual pages that display the prepared data using templates.

    <p>
      FreeMarker is <em>not</em> a Web application framework. It is suitable as a
      component in a Web application framework, but the FreeMarker engine itself knows
      nothing about HTTP or servlets. It simply generates text. As such, it is perfectly
      usable in non-web application environments as well. Note, however, that we provide
      out-of-the-box solutions for using FreeMarker as the view component of Model 2 frameworks (e.g. Struts),
      which also let you use JSP taglibs in the templates.
