/**
 * Soft cache storage is a cache storage that uses {@link SoftReference} 
 * objects to hold the objects it was passed, therefore allows the garbage
 * collector to purge the cache when it determines that it wants to free up
 * memory.
 * This class is thread-safe to the extent that its underlying map is. The 
 * default implementation uses a concurrent map on Java 5 and above, so it is
 * thread-safe in that case.
