 * <tt>Map.get()</tt> method. Note that if the passed argument itself is a
 * reflection-wrapper model, then the map lookup will be performed using the
 * wrapped object as the key. Note that you can call <tt>get()</tt> using the

 * You can, however use <tt>map.entrySet()</tt>, <tt>map.keySet()</tt>, or
 * <tt>map.values()</tt> to obtain {@link freemarker.template.TemplateCollectionModel} instances for 
 * various aspects of the map.</p>
