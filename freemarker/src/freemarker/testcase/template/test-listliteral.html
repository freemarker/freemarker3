<title>FreeMarker: List Literal Test</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>A simple test follows:</p>

<p>${message}</p>

<p>Now perform a list assignment:</p>

[#assign hash = {"temp" : "Temporary"}]
[#assign mymessage = "hello"]
[#assign test = ["test1", "test23", "test45", message, mymessage]]

The list contains #{test?size} items.

[#list test as item]
<p>${item}</p>
[/#list]

<p>Now update the assignment and repeat:</p>

[#assign mymessage = "world"]

[#list test as item]
<p>${item}</p>
[/#]

<p>Now reassign the list and repeat:</p>

[#assign test = [hash.temp, "test1", "test23", "test45", mymessage, "hash", hash["temp"]]]
[#assign test = ["foo", "bar"]+test]

[#list test[1..4] as item]
<p>${item}</p>
[/#]

<p>Silly, but necessary tests, for one and zero element lists:</p>

[#assign test = ["Hello, world"]]

[#list test as item]
<p>${item}</p>
[/#]

<p>Zero item test:</p>

[#assign test = []]

[#list test as item]
<p>${item}</p>
[/#]

<p>Dumb test for number literals -- these weren't working as expected:</p>

[#assign test = []+[1, 2, 3, 5, 7]]

[#list test as item]
<p>${item}</p>
[#if item = 5][#break][/#if]
[/#]
