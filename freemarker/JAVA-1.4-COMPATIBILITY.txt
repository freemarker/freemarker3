Under Java 1.4 you must use the freemarker-14compat.jar instead of the
freemarker.jar! The freemarker.jar is for Java 5 (and later).
Java 1.3 and earlier is not supported anymore.


Details for those who are interested
------------------------------------

FreeMarker 2.4 is developed against Java 5, like it uses annotations in
its public API. Java 1.4 compatibility is achieved via the
Retrotranslator tool. See: http://retrotranslator.sf.net/

The license terms for retrotranslator are exact the same BSD-style license
that FreeMarker uses.

Obviously, for building FreeMarker, you will need at least JDK 1.5. Note
that the "retrotrans" and "retrojar" Ant build targets respectively use
retrotranslator to build the .class files and .jar file that are compatible
with 1.4. The 1.4-compatible .jar file is significantly bigger than the
regular freemarker.jar since it contains runtime support classes from
retrotranslator.
