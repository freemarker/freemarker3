<h1>FreeMarker Struts Example</h1>

<p>This is an example of using FreeMarker templates instead of JSP with Struts 1.1.
You can find more information about FreeMarker and "Model 2" applications in the FreeMarker Manual.

<p><b>Before deploying this Web application</b>, you <em>must</em> copy the .jar files that are commonly required for Struts applications (sruts.jar, common-...jar-s)
into the <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> directory manually, or the Web application will not start. You may find these files in the lib
directory of the Struts distribution, or in the <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> directory of examples comes with
the Struts distribution.
(The FreeMarker distribution does not contain these files since they are too big.)

<p>To try this example you should visit
<a href="index.do"><code>http://<i>yourServer</i>/<i>thisWebApp</i>/index.do</code></a>

<p><b>Note:</b> To simplify the example, the guest-book entries are not stored
persistently. If you reload the servlet all guest-book entry will lose.
