What is FreeMarker?
-------------------

FreeMarker is a Java tool to generate text output based on templates.
It is designed to be practical as a template engine to generate web
pages and particularly for servlet-based page production that follows
the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern. That is, you can separate the
work of Java programmers and website designers - Java programmers
needn't know how to design nice websites, and website designers needn't
know Java programming.

FreeMarker is licensed under a liberal BSD-style open source license. 
This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software.

Installing

example, if you use FreeMarker in a web application, you probably want
to put freemarker.jar into the WEB-INF/lib directory of your web
application.
